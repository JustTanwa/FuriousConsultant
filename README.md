# Furious Consultant

This is a small project website for me to learn about creating landing page and web site layout. I will be using the a fictional company and characters from the Fast and Furious movie franchise. 

## Tech Stack

I will be using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and little jQuery for this project.

### Goals

I want to have a website with a CTA button on the landing page. As well as explore a couple of pages to test layout of forms and information page.

### Credits

I will be using TMDb for the movie database information and images will be taken from Unsplash.
